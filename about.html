        Currently working on 100 Days of Code - The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp
        for 2021, check my progress here: https://twitter.com/skaftisveins
        Programmer with two years of experience and a graduate from a three
        semester programming course at ntv school. In the first semester I was
        introduced to C#, SQL and we finished by creating a desktop application
        using .NET and WPF. Second semester we did html, css and javascript, and
        later one we got introduced to Angular framework, nodejs as well as web
        API and REST. My final project was called Hero Cards, which I enjoyed
        creating and designing. Third semester was a bit of a let down to begin
        with, Xamarin mobile programming. But later we got introduced to react and
        there after Flutter framework. Finished the school and this last semester
        by creating an app for Skotveiðifélag Keflavíkur. Right after graduating I
        created a new website for our family company, www.hoppogskopp.is. Then in
        these past couple of months, during this coronavirus time, I have been
        keeping myself busy by self-learning about Flutter, react and now
        currently Python.
